# Empirical Study of the Attention Mechanism for Accent Recognition

This study focuses on the influence of the attention mechanism in accent recognition. We want to test and compare models with and without different attention-based layers (attention and self-attention) to check whether there is a significant difference between these approaches. The main idea of the attention mechanism is that it looks not only at the current token of the input sequence but also at the other elements, saturating our token with contextual information. That is the core question of our study: can such information contribute to accent recognition?
